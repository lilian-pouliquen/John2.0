## First try to create a game with python language

A little game where you have to find some passwords to continue.
In development...
There's a plenty of dialogs in French (do not be afraid)
Sorry, comments are in French too, I will translate it when I will have the time

### Wanna help me?
Please if you want to help me, I am trying to make a "fight" (as in Pokemon games you know?), where the user can choose the actions, and fight the "Corruption".
