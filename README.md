## First try to create a game with python language

A little game where you have to find some passwords to continue.

### In development...
Developed with Spyder IDE, WinPython 64 bits v3.6.5 

There are plenty of dialogs in French (do not be afraid)

Sorry, comments are in French too, I will translate it when I will have the time

### Wanna help me?
Please if you want to help me, I am trying to make a "fight" (as in Pokemon games you know?), where the user can choose the actions, and fight the "Corruption".
==> file location : module/deplacer.py

There are also data entry checks, other bug fixes to make, and maybe other stuff I did not see.

Thank you for your help!
